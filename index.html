                                <p>To apply for an account, you need to be at least 15 years old.
                                    We will terminate an account if we learn that the subject in question violated this rule. We apologize for the

                                <p> Upon closing your account, it will first be deactivated and then deleted in 30 days. 
                                    While your account is deactivated, all of your comments or activities 
                                    available to our community will be anonymized and remain where they are.
                                    Events that you've made will be removed.

                                <p> For the 30 days after deactivation, you can still restore your account (whether or not it was purposefully deleted), which will link back your 
                                    comments, activities, events and content back to your account. We will notify you by the email address linked to 
                                    your account on these circumstances or the next time you attempt to access your account. After those 30 days, we will permanently

                                    non-infringement, and any warranties implied by any course of dealing or performance. </p>

                                <p> Responsibility for Content. All content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility

                                    of damages (direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary), whatever the type of claim 
                                    or loss (breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of warranty, or any other claim or loss), (c) any lost 
                                    profits, data or revenues, or (d) any conduct or content of other users or third parties on the Site or the Services. 
                                    In no event shall EventFull‚Äôs liability for damages be in excess of (in the aggregate) one hundred Canadian dollars ($100.00). </p>

                                <p> Your liability to EventFull. If you do something that gets us sued, or break any of the promises you make in these Terms of Service, 
                                    you shall compensate us for any liabilities, losses, claims, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and costs) that arise from 
                                    or relate to your use or misuse of the Services. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise 
                                    subject to this clause, in which case you agree that you‚Äôll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses. </p>

                                    such as messages and follower alerts, by adjusting your preferences 
                                    in the Notifications section of your account Settings. You may also

                            <p> There‚Äôs a fine line between promoting your stories and spamming. 
                                The more you can make your message personal and relevant, the 
                                less likely you are to be reported for spam. Don‚Äôt promote your 
                                stories as a comment on other people‚Äôs stories. Do not link to
                                e-commerce or other similar sites, or post comments to promote 
                                other products or services; we consider this spam and nobody 
                                likes spam. Comments, messages and club posts sent via bots 
                                will result in immediate deletion of accounts. However, you 
                                are welcomed to link your published novels that are for sale 
                                on your own profile.</p>
                            <hr>
